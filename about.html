            <h4>Origin and Purpose</h4>
            <p>The Nova Scotia Duck Tolling Retriever was developed in Nova Scotia in the early 19th century to toll (or lure) and retrieve waterfowl. The tolling dog runs, jumps, and plays along the shoreline in full view of a flock of ducks, occasionally disappearing from sight and then quickly reappearing, aided by the hidden hunter, who throws small sticks or a ball for the dog. The dogs are  playful actions lure the curious ducks within gunshot range. The dog is then sent to retrieve the downed bird.</p>
                
            <h4>General Appearance</h4>
            <p>The Toller is a medium-sized, powerful, compact, balanced, well-muscled dog; medium to heavy in bone, with a high degree of agility, alertness, and determination. Many Tollers have a slightly sad expression until they go to work, when their aspect changes to intense concentration and excitement. At work, the dog has a speeding, rushing action, with the head carried out almost level with the back and heavily-feathered tail in constant motion.</p>

            <h4>Temperament</h4>
            <p>The Toller is highly intelligent, easy to train, and has great endurance. A strong and able swimmer, he is a natural and tenacious retriever on land and from water, setting himself for springy action the moment the slightest indication is given that retrieving is required. His strong retrieving desire and playfulness are qualities essential to his tolling ability.</p>

            <p>Loving and playful to his family, he can be reserved with strangers without being aggressive or overly shy. Aggression is not to be tolerated.</p>

            <h4>Size</h4>
            <p>Ideal height for males over 18 months is 19-20 inches (48-51 cm); females over 18 months 18-19 inches (45-48 cm). One inch (3 cm) over or under ideal height is allowed. Weight should be in proportion to the height and bone of the dog guidelines: 45-51 lb. (20-23 kg) for adult males; bitches 37-43 lb. (17-20 kg).</p>

        <div class="col-6_sm-12 padded">
            <h4>Coat and Colour</h4>
            <p>The Toller was bred to retrieve from icy waters and must have a water-repellent double coat of medium length and softness with a softer, dense undercoat. The coat may have a slight wave on the back, but is otherwise straight. Some winter coats may form a long, loose curl at the throat. Featherings are soft at the throat behind the ears and at the back of the thighs, and forelegs are moderately feathered. While neatening of the ears and feet is permitted, the Toller should always appear natural. Colour is various shades of red or orange with lighter featherings and underside of tail, and usually at least one of the following white markings at tip of tail, feet (not exceeding beyond the pasterns), chest, and blaze. A dog of otherwise high quality is not to be penalized for lack of white. The pigment of the nose, lips and eye rims should match, and be flesh coloured, blending with coat, or be black.</p>

        <div class="col-6_sm-12 padded">
            <h4>Head</h4>
            <p>Skull: the head, which should be in proportion to the body size, is clean-cut and slightly wedge-shaped when viewed from above. The broad skull is only slightly rounded, the occiput not prominent and the cheeks flat. Length from occiput to stop should roughly equal that of stop to tip of nose. The stop is moderate. Muzzle: tapers in a clean line from stop to nose, with the lower jaw strong but not prominent.</p>
            <p>The underline of the muzzle runs almost in a straight line from the corner of the lip to the corner of the jawbone, with depth at the stop being greater than at the nose. Hair on the muzzle is short and fine. Whiskers are not removed. Nose tapers from bridge to tip, with nostrils well open. Colour should blend with that of the coat or be black. Mouth: lips fit fairly tightly, forming a gentle curve in profile, with no heaviness in flews. The correct bite is tight scissors, full dentition is required. Overshot by more than 1/8 inch, under shot and wry mouth are highly undesirable. Jaws are strong enough to carry a sizable bird, and softness in mouth is essential. Eyes set well apart, almond shaped, medium-sized. Colour, amber to brown. Expression is friendly, alert and intelligent. Flesh around the eyes should be the same colour as the lips.</p>
            <p>Ears triangular, rounded at the tips, medium-sized and carried in a dropped fashion. They are set high and well back on the skull, with the base held very slightly erect so that the edge of the ear is carried to the side of the head. They are well feathered at and behind the fold, with short hair at the tips.</p>

            <p>Elbows should be close to the body, turning neither in nor out, working cleanly and evenly. The forelegs should appear as parallel columns, straight and strong in bone. The pasterns are strong and slightly sloping. The strongly-webbed feet are tight and round, with well-arched toes, thick pads and strong nails, and are in proportion to the size of the dog. Dewclaws may be removed.</p>

            <h4>Gait</h4>
            <p>The Toller combines an impression of power with a springy, jaunty gait, showing good reach in front and a strong driving rear. Feet should turn neither in nor out and the legs travel in a straight line. As speed increases, the dog should single-track, topline remaining level, and covering ground with economy of movement.</p>

        <h2>So you're looking for a Toller?</h2>
        <p>Here are some important things to think about and ask your prospective breeder. If, for any reason you don't get to see all this, or someone doesn't want or can't tell and show you these, just walk away and try to find a responsible breeder, someone who cares for the health of the breed.</p>

            <h4>Pedigree</h4>
            <p>Ask to see the pedigree of both parents, at least the mother's and a copy of the father's to determine how related they are. Ask for a conformation in writing that the puppies will have an official pedigree.</p>

            <i class="fa-solid fa-bone big-icon"></i>
            <h4>Age</h4>
            <p>Look at the age of the parents. The bitch and the stud dog should be 2 years old.</p>

            <i class="fa-solid fa-house-chimney-window big-icon"></i>
            <h4>Early Life</h4>
            <p>Make sure the puppies grow up in the house, living with the family. Toller puppies (in fact every puppy) need a lot of socialising, and getting used to house-life.</p>
